## PROJECTE ASW - HACKERNEWS
This is an university project where a clone of the website HackerNews had to be done in two different frameworks and deploy it twice. 

* First step: A Ruby project with all the features HackerNews originally has.
* Second step: Document the API we created in Ruby in Swagger. (YAML file)
* Third step: Create a project with a Javascript framework (React).
